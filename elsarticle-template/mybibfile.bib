  abstract = {Background The dynamic changes and stability of blood biomarkers over time and after treatment are not well known. In this study, we describe changes in 12 centrally quantified known and novel cardiovascular biomarkers, prior to and 3 months after ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF). Purpose In patients enrolled in the AXAFA-AFNET5 trial, we 1) characterised changes in 12 biomarker levels pre and post-ablation, 2) ascertained if biomarker changes are consistent between males and females, and 3) identified biomarkers which predict recurrent AF post-ablation. Methods and results Of the 674 patients who were recruited and randomised, 633 received the study drug and underwent ablation. Peripheral blood samples were available for 488 patients at baseline and 434 at 3 months follow-up (median age [Q1, Q3] 64 [58, 70] years; 34\% female). Between baseline (BL) and follow-up (FU), paired comparisons revealed that 3 biomarkers decreased, ANG2 (median [Q1, Q3] BL 2.185 [1.711, 3.115], FU 1.827 [1.457, 2.297] ng/mL, p{$<$}0.001), BMP10 (BL 2.056 [1.810, 2.380], FU 1.986 [1.757, 2.260] ng/mL, p{$<$}0.001), and NTproBNP (BL 2.219 [0.858, 5.731] per 100pg/mL, p{$<$}0.001), while 1 biomarker increased, FABP3 (BL 2.911 [2.425, 3.508], FU 2.911 [2.462, 3.521], p=0.005). The remaining 8 biomarkers remained unchanged. Significant differences in ANG2, BMP10, NTproBNP and FABP3 were driven by patients who remained arrhythmia free at follow-up whereas biomarker levels remained unchanged in 121 patients who experienced recurrent AF (39\%; Figure). Change scores were mainly consistent between males and females, however, CRP decreased significantly more in females. Recurrent AF episodes were not different between males and females (p=0.319). Cox proportional hazards model assessed the relationship of individual biomarkers at baseline for predicting recurrent AF. Elevated ANG2 (hazard ratio, HR per ng/mL [95\% confidence interval] 1.214 [1.113, 1.325]), BMP10 (HR per ng/mL 1.516 [1.039, 2.214]), and NTproBNP (HR per 100 pg/mL 1.050 [1.025, 1.076]) significantly predicted increased risk for recurrent AF, after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, heart failure, ablation type (PVI, PVI and other, other), ablation energy (radiofrequency, cryoablation, other), and treatment arm. Conclusion In this study, most cardiovascular biomarkers are unchanged after ablation for AF, however, ANG2, BMP10, and NTproBNP decreased at follow-up. These effects are driven by patients who remained arrhythmia free and could potentially reflect improvement in vascular (ANG2), endothelial (BMP10), and myocardial load (NTproBNP) parameters post-ablation. This outcome corresponds with the observation that elevated levels of these biomarkers at baseline predict recurrent AF at 3 months. Both males and females demonstrate similar changes in biomarker profiles and benefit equally from ablation for AF.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia. It has been estimated that 6-12 million people worldwide will suffer this condition in the US by 2050 and 17.9 million people in Europe by 2060. Atrial fibrillation is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke and provokes important economic burden along with significant morbidity and mortality. AIM: We provide here comprehensive and updated statistics on worldwide epidemiology of atrial fibrillation. METHODS: An electronic search was conducted for atrial fibrillation. The epidemiologic information was retrieved from the Global Health Data Exchange database, which is regarded as one of the most comprehensive worldwide catalogs of surveys, censuses, vital statistics, and other health-related data. RESULTS: A total of 3.046 million new cases of atrial fibrillation worldwide were registered in the database during 2017. The estimated incidence rate for 2017 (403/millions inhabitants) was 31\% higher than the corresponding incidence in 1997. The worldwide prevalence of atrial fibrillation is 37,574 million cases (0.51\% of worldwide population), increased also by 33\% during the last 20 years. The highest burden is seen in countries with high socio-demographic index, though the largest recent increased occurred in middle socio-demographic index countries. Future projections suggest that absolute atrial fibrillation burden may increase by {$>$}60\% in 2050. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses suggest that atrial fibrillation incidence and prevalence have increased over the last 20 years and will continue to increase over the next 30 years, especially in countries with middle socio-demographic index, becoming one of the largest epidemics and public health challenges.},

  abstract = {Objective: To identify electrographic characteristics associated with increased seizure risk in patients with BIPDs on EEG. Background: Bilateral independent periodic discharges (BIPDs) are increasingly recognized in critically ill patients. Electrographic characteristics associated with increased seizure risk are unclear. Methods: This is a retrospective review of 88 patients with BIPDs. EEG modifiers for BIPDs were defined based on the ACNS Critical Care EEG Terminology. Electrographic seizures and Electrographic Status Epilepticus were defined based on Modified Salzburg Criteria. Results: 39 (44\%) patients had seizures during monitoring. EEG characteristics associated with increased seizure risk included continuous prevalence ((OR=2.83, 95\%CI 1.17-6.87, p=0.02), whereas very brief duration was associated with decreased seizure risk (OR=0.08, 95\%CI= 0.01-0.60, p=0.003). 20 (23\%) patients had electrographic status epilepticus during monitoring. EEG characteristics associated with increased SE risk included frequency {$>$}1 Hz (OR=3.89, 95\%CI 1.37-11.07, p=0.008), continuous prevalence (OR=2.87, 95\%CI 1.03-8.01, p=0.04), spiky morphology (OR=4.62, 95\%CI 1.38-15.43, p=0.015), and low absolute amplitude (OR=4.62, 95\%CI 1.38-15.43, p=0.015). 33 (37.5 \%) patients died during the hospital stay. EEG characteristics associated with increased mortality risk included very long duration (OR=3.17, 95\%CI 1.25-8.01, p=0.013), low absolute amplitude (OR=3.75, 95\%CI 1.13-12.41, p=0.024), and association with rhythmic discharges (OR=3.33, 95\%CI 1.22-9.07, p=0.016). 72 (82\%) patients had poor short-term outcome (GOS 1-3). No EEG characteristics were significantly associated with poor outcome. Conclusion: EEG characteristics may help stratify seizure and SE risk in patients with BIPDs. Continuous prevalence was associated with increased seizure risk. Frequencies {$>$} 1 Hz, continuous prevalence, spiky morphology and low absolute amplitudes were associated with increased SE risk. Very long duration, low absolute amplitude and association with rhythmic discharges were associated with increased mortality risk.},

  abstract = {Purpose:  The long-term electrographic features of lateralized periodic discharges (LPD) and their impact on clinical management are unclear. The authors investigated routine EEGs (rEEG) to analyze the delayed natural history of LPDs, and studied the clinical care of these patients. Methods: After IRB approval, the prospectively maintained continuous EEG (cEEG) database was searched to identify patients fulfilling the following criteria: LPDs on cEEG, age {$\geq$}18 years, no epilepsy history, and rEEG completed within 1 to 12 months of hospital discharge. Their rEEGs were reviewed followed by clinical data extraction. Appropriate statistical tools were used for data analysis. Results: Thirty-nine patients (20 females) with a mean age of 63.3 {$\pm$} 16.8 years at the time of cEEG fulfilled the study criteria. Thirty-three (85\%) had associated electrographic seizures. rEEG was performed 4.7 {$\pm$} 3.5 months after cEEG. Seven (18\%) patients had interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) on the rEEG. The LPDs on cEEG of these patients were more often continuous, with an amplitude {$>$}2 times their background compared with 10 (26\%) patients with normal rEEGs findings. After a mean follow-up of 19.8 {$\pm$} 9.9 months, 11 (31\%) patients developed epilepsy, but only 3 had IEDs on their rEEG. Majority (86\%) of patients were on AEDs at the time of last follow-up. Conclusions: LPDs lead to markers of epileptogenicity in around 18\% of patients. One-third of the study population developed epilepsy. rEEG findings were not found to be good indicators of epilepsy development in our small, retrospective study limited by its sampling bias. Indiscriminate, long-term use of AEDs in these patients is a concerning finding.}

  abstract = {The past 3 decades have been characterized by an exponential growth in knowledge and advances in the clinical treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). It is now known that AF genesis requires a vulnerable atrial substrate and that the formation and composition of this substrate may vary depending on comorbid conditions, genetics, sex, and other factors. Population-based studies have identified numerous factors that modify the atrial substrate and increase AF susceptibility. To date, genetic studies have reported 17 independent signals for AF at 14 genomic regions. Studies have established that advanced age, male sex, and European ancestry are prominent AF risk factors. Other modifiable risk factors include sedentary lifestyle, smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and elevated blood pressure predispose to AF, and each factor has been shown to induce structural and electric remodeling of the atria. Both heart failure and myocardial infarction increase risk of AF and vice versa creating a feed-forward loop that increases mortality. Other cardiovascular outcomes attributed to AF, including stroke and thromboembolism, are well established, and epidemiology studies have championed therapeutics that mitigate these adverse outcomes. However, the role of anticoagulation for preventing dementia attributed to AF is less established. Our review is a comprehensive examination of the epidemiological data associating unmodifiable and modifiable risk factors for AF and of the pathophysiological evidence supporting the mechanistic link between each risk factor and AF genesis. Our review also critically examines the epidemiological data on clinical outcomes attributed to AF and summarizes current evidence linking each outcome with AF.},
